Expense Tracker - Architectural Decision Records
ADR-001: Choice of Jetpack Compose over Traditional Views
Status: Accepted
Context: The Expense Tracker app requires a modern, maintainable UI framework that supports Material Design 3, theme switching (dark/light), and accessibility features like TalkBack. The team needs to choose between traditional Android Views (XML layouts) and Jetpack Compose for the UI implementation.
Decision: We will use Jetpack Compose as the primary UI framework for all screens and components.
Consequences:
Positive:
•	Declarative UI paradigm reduces boilerplate code and improves maintainability
•	Built-in support for Material Design 3 components and theming
•	Excellent state management integration with ViewModels
•	Better performance for dynamic UI updates (expense list updates, theme switching)
•	Type-safe navigation and better testing capabilities
•	Simplified theme switching implementation
•	Better accessibility support out of the box
Negative:
•	Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Compose
•	Larger APK size compared to traditional Views (though still within 20MB constraint)
•	Some advanced customizations may require more effort initially
Alternatives Considered:
•	Traditional XML Views with Data Binding: Rejected due to increased complexity for theme switching and state management
•	Hybrid approach (mixing Views and Compose): Rejected to maintain consistency and avoid integration complexity

Decision: We will use Jetpack Navigation Compose for handling all navigation within the application.
Consequences:
Positive:
•	Type-safe navigation with compile-time verification
•	Excellent integration with Compose UI
•	Built-in support for animation transitions
•	Proper handling of system back button and deep links
•	Centralized navigation logic
•	Support for nested navigation graphs for future modularization
Negative:
•	Limited customization options for complex navigation patterns
•	Learning curve for Navigation Compose API
•	Potential memory retention issues if not properly managed
Alternatives Considered:
•	Manual navigation with Compose: Rejected due to increased complexity and lack of type safety
•	Third-party navigation libraries: Rejected to minimize dependencies
•	Activity-based navigation: Rejected due to performance overhead and complexity
________________________________________
ADR-006: State Management Strategy
Status: Accepted
Context: The app requires reactive state management for UI updates, data synchronization between screens, and handling loading/error states. Performance requirements specify UI transitions within 500ms.
Decision: We will use a combination of ViewModel with StateFlow/Flow and Compose's state management (remember, mutableStateOf) for UI state management.
Consequences:
Positive:
•	Reactive data streams with Flow provide automatic UI updates
•	Clear separation between UI state and business state
•	Excellent performance with minimal recompositions
•	Built-in lifecycle awareness prevents memory leaks
•	Type-safe state representation with data classes
•	Easy testing of state transitions
Negative:
•	Complexity in managing multiple state sources
•	Potential for state inconsistencies if not properly managed
•	Learning curve for Flow operators and StateFlow
Alternatives Considered:
•	LiveData: Rejected due to lack of first-class Compose support
•	MVI with Redux-like pattern: Rejected as over-engineering for app complexity
•	Direct database observation in Compose: Rejected due to poor separation of concerns

Status: Accepted
Context: The app needs a clear package structure that supports Clean Architecture principles and future modularization. The structure must be intuitive for new developers while supporting the planned feature modules (:expense, :settings, :auth).
Decision: We will use a layered package structure within a single module initially, organized by architectural layers (presentation, domain, data) with feature-based sub-packages, and a clear migration path to multi-module architecture.
Consequences:
Positive:
•	Clear architectural boundaries enforced by package structure
•	Easy to locate and modify related functionality
•	Supports future extraction into feature modules
•	Consistent with Clean Architecture principles
•	Facilitates parallel development by different team members
Negative:
•	Initial over-organization for a simple app
